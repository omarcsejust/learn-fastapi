# Setup

- [Configure Virtual Environment(venv)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKL6wEqbyNs)
- Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Although I provided venv file in git repo, if it works for you then you don't need to install any dependency, or if it doesn't work for you then delete venv folder and setup venv and install dependencies from requirements.txt

# How to run?

- Open terminal and type: uvicorn main:app --reload
- Hit enter
- --reload for auto detect changes in server
